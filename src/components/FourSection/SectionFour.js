            I wanted a marriage that was loving, respectful, & supportive. I
            faced challenges including unruly emotions, emotional abuse, &
            constant disrespect. I had been doing research for months, & when I
            came across a term called Emotional Intelligence, it all started to
            make sense.
          </p>
          <p className="four_section_cart_p">
            I spent over 8 years researching & studying the subject. I took
            personal time to focus on myself, & my mindset changed from negative
            to positive; it felt like empowerment! I learned how important it is
            not only for me & for others in any kind of relationship, that when
            you learn about yourself as well as manage your feelings, you will
            not become overwhelmed by angry outbursts or choices you will
            regret.
          </p>
          <p className="four_section_cart_p">
            I learned that I could brilliantly become more in-tune with myself
            by tapping into my own feelings for guidance and for help to make
            the right choices, hence the definition of emotional intelligence. I
            know now that we have all the power and brilliance already inside of
            us that can easily be tapped into when we are open, conscious, &
            willing. It was enlightening to learn that my having a deep
            understanding of myself will help me have better relationships with
            those I love & to navigate the challenges of life more successfully.
          </p>

            It's time to get in-tune with yourself &/or to support those you
            serve or who serve you. I offer an eight-step process called the Why
            You Matter Playbook. It is a 6-week coaching and knowledge-based
            course, in-person or through a group setting, that helps you
            understand yourself, your emotions, & use what you learn as new
            information to help you move toward the desired outcomes that you
            want in your life & business.
